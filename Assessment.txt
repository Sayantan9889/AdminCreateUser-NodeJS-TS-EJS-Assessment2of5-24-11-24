----------------
    1.Create a MongoDB database with following collections: 
        a. Users 
        b. Roles (roles include Super Admin, User) 
        c. Categories 
        d. Subcategory
        e. product

    2.Perform the following tasks: 
        a.The Super Admin has the authority to add Admins and Users by providing their details. 
        b. Upon adding an Admin or User, they will receive a confirmation email along with an autogenerated password, allowing them to log into the application.
     
    c.In the dashboard there are following menus 
        i. Home: Displays the total number of products, categories, and subcategories. Also displays the total number of products under each specific category and subcategory. 
        ii. Users: Accessible by both Super Admin and Admin. They can add, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete Users. 
        iii. Product: Accessible by all two roles (Super Admin, User). Allows adding, editing, and deleting products. Products can be added under a specific category and subcategory. In the product listing show product name, category name, subcategory name and price. 
        iv. Category: Accessible to all roles. Allows for adding, editing, and deleting categories. The category list displays the category name along with its subcategories. 
        v. Subcategory: Accessible to both roles. Allows for adding, editing, and deleting subcategories within specific categories. The subcategory list shows the subcategory name along with the name of its associated category. 
     
Note: Use a MongoDB aggregation query with the pipeline feature. The template engine to be used is EJS. Also, category and subcategory should be in a single collection called categories. Don’t use any populate or any raw JS query for fetching data from MongoDB.
